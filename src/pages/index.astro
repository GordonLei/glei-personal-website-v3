            <p>
              My name is Gordon Lei. During 8th grade, I fell in love with
              creating simple applications such as the "Counting to 24" math
              game on something that was tangental to computer science but key
              to any student's toolkit: a TI-84 graphing calculator. From
              creating such applets I fell in love with programming as anything
              I imagined could be created if I put my heart and time into it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to today, my love for programming had led me to
              graduate from CMU with a Masters of Science in Software
              Engineering as well as graduated from NYU with a Bachelors of
              Science in Computer Science. I have helped create potential
              inhouse tools and front-end frameworks during my internship at
              CrossBorder Solutions and have deployed proof-of-concepts on the
              cloud during my internship at Becton Dickinson.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I am not working on school work or personal projects, I am
              usually pursuing my passion of photography, hanging out with
              friends, or on the Rift.
